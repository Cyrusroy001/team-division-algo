This is a small, fun piece of code I wrote when me and my group of friends were confused amongst ourselves as to how should we divide teams for taking part in the upcoming hackathon. 
This algorithm utilizes the built-in random module and assigns each participant a random number for 1000 rounds (can be changed to any number of rounds), and finally puts him/her to 
a team based on the most common random assignment.

For example: if 'Cyrus' got put into the teams as: Team A- 20 times, Team B- 50 times, and Team C- 30 times, for 100 rounds, 'Cyrus' will be put in Team B (highest number of occurrence).
This occurs for every participant in the dictionary.
